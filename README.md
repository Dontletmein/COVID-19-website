# The Live Status of Novel Coronavirus in New Zealand
This site shows the lastest COVID-19 status of New Zealand. It is live at [http://www.covid-19-nz.tk/](http://www.covid-19-nz.tk/).
This site contains the following information from trust resources including:
* The overall confirmed, suspend and recovered cases;
* The trend of affected cases;
* The map location of region cases; (cannot accurate to patients since limited information)


The API we are using comes form [this](https://nzcovid19api.xerra.nz/). <br/>
This project was inspired from [this site](https://covid-19-au.com/). Due to the limited knowledge of javascript and node.js, we cannot follow the [template](https://ncov.shanyue.tech/) which covid 19 au is based on.
## UPDATE 
The detailed cases from this API had been archived which make the location and cases section unable to load. We are currently fixing this issue.<br/>
