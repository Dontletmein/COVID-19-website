# The Live Status of Novel Coronavirus in New Zealand
This site shows the lastest COVID-19 status of New Zealand. It is live at [http://www.covid-19-nz.tk/](http://www.covid-19-nz.tk/).
This site contains the following information from trust resources including:
* The overall confirmed, suspend and recovered cases;
* The trend of affected cases;
* The map location of region cases; (cannot accurate to patients since limited information)


The API we are using comes form [this](https://nzcovid19api.xerra.nz/). <br/>
This project was inspired from [this site](https://covid-19-au.com/). Due to the limited knowledge of javascript and node.js, we cannot follow the [template](https://ncov.shanyue.tech/) which covid 19 au is based on.
## UPDATE 
### 2020/07/05
Due to the closure of API, we decided to close this repo and stop updating the website...
As a result, this website is using Blazor framework but we suppose using nodejs or reactjs could make it more interactive and visual. 
This is our very first project but it won't be our last
Hope the best and we can overcome this crisis ;)
